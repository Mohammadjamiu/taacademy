                    This section will be introducing the most important
                    circuits or electronics components because most of this components
                    are what circuits are composed or are made up of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To start off with the one we are most familiar with which is a battery.
                    <br> <span class="text-emphasis">A battery</span> is considered as one of the source of voltage. It
                    has
                    symbols in circuit analysis as shown below:

                <p>
                    The next component of discussion is the
                    <span class="text-emphasis">resistor,</span> which offers resistance
                    in a circuit and by its name tends to resist or limits the flow of
                    current in a circuit or branches in a circuit. Though it might sound
                    kind of a bad thing to have but the truth is if you try to connect a
                    9v battery to a torch that is capable of handling 3v then it’s going
                    to blow off. So that’s where resistor can come in to play by
                    limiting the amount of current flow as well as voltage across.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/tourchy_3.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>
                    As you can see in the image above, resistor has a wiggly or zigzag
                    symbol. Below, it values is also written by it side which can be 4ohms, 20mOhms(milliOhms) etc.
                </p>

                <img src="../images/resistory_1.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>
                    As battery is something we can get in the market place, resistor too
                    can be bought as a separate or discrete component and on it there is
                    no written value as we used to do if we are to analyze a circuit
                    rather it has a color code and this color code can be decoded and it
                    value can be known by referencing the datasheet.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/resistorlooky_1 (1).jpg" alt="" />
                <p>
                    Now you might think that the next component should be current
                    no-no-no, current is not a discrete component and it is not what we
                    can see, touch or hold. It just magically flows through a conductive
                    material like wire or a resistor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another component that most of us might be familiar with is the capacitor. <br><br>
                    <span class="text-emphasis">A capacitor</span> in simple term is a passive device or component
                    that
                    store charges for a temporary period (more explanation would be
                    covered in other section).
                </p>
                <p>To even get a bigger picture of how a
                    capacitor works is, have you ever seen any device that you
                    disconnect its power supply but is still turned on for a little
                    seconds? if yes then it’s the capacitor that’s providing it stored
                    energy but over a short period of time and it is useful because of
                    the fluctuation that most power supply has which can destroy our
                    devices.</p>
                <p>
                    It symbol is shown below and as always it value is written by it
                    side both when we are analysing circuit or when you go to buy the
                    component in the market. Unit is Farad (F) and values can be 4uF(microFarad), 3F etc.

                    With the explanation of diode, it would be cool to talk about the transistor. <br><br> <span

                    The transistor is based on the combination of certain diodes in a certain configuration and has a

                <p> <span class="text-emphasis">The fuse</span> is a safety component that is mostly installed or
                    inserted between an energy source and the
                    devices. This means that if there is excessive current drawn or fault, it’s just going to break off
                    and save those devices</p>
                <img src="../images/fusey_1.jpg" alt="" />

                <p>In summary this is the most common component that we would encounter or most likely work with.
                    Warning don’t stress out just go through them and get a little snippet of what this stuffs are and
                    as time goes on thing will become clearer.
