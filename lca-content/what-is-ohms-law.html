          <h2>what is ohm's law and why do we need it</h2>
          <p>
       The ohm
          </p>
          <p>
            The use case of circuits are endless which leads to new technology
            coming up everyday. But before we can design or know how microchips
            are built, we first need to understand how to analyze simple
            circuits using different techniques that are developed by other
            engineers to help ease our life.
          </p>
          <h2>What is circuit in general?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-emphasis">A circuit or electric circuit</span> is
            a close loop that allows the flow of electricity. if the loop is not
            closed but composed of electrical or electronics components, we call
            it an <span class="text-italics">electrical network</span>.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/closelool-openloop_1.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Now let’s dive in and talk about the concept of voltage, current and
            resistance which if the understanding is not clear might make us not
            to understand how to analyze a circuit.
          </p>
          <h2>What is current?</h2>
          <p>
            To start with current is,
            <span class="text-emphasis">Current</span> constitutes or is the
            flow of electrons in a circuit. You can think of 'ocean current'
            which involve stream of water flow instead.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every wire or conductor has or is composed of atoms which consist of
            many protons, electrons and neutrons. These electrons are stationary
            since there are an equal number of positive ion (protons) and that
            of negative ion (electrons), which means it's in a balance state.
            But to make it useful, we apply a battery which provides force
            called <span class="text-italics">voltage</span> to push the
            electrons inside the wire and as soon as electron flows or moves, we
            get current.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/electron-wire_1.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Since electron is the negative ion which means if we connect a
            battery to a device like a torch, current flows from the negative
            side of the battery to the positive side. But by convention of
            analyzing circuits for ease, instead of moving backward or from
            negative to positive, it is adopted that current flows from positive
            to negative, you need to get this right.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/current-denote_1.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            The flow of this current is quantified using the unit ampere or amps
            for short and denoted as A. sometimes this unit are based on
            metrics, meaning we do have mA (milliAmps), uA (microAmps) and so
            on. The higher the amps the higher the current and vice versa.

              It is current that kills not voltage. But a task is assigned to
              you, which is to find out how much current is sufficient to kill
              so we can be cautious.

              But if you are curious you can ask us to tell you. Always remember

          <h2>What is voltage?</h2>
          <p>
            As we've seen from our discussion, we say that the force to push
            current through a wire is voltage and that's the simplified
            definition of what voltage is because, voltage doesn't move through
            a circuit as current does but it is across a circuit or circuit
            component.
          </p>
          <p>
            A voltage is a source of energy and can be our battery or socket
            outlet from our home. Voltage has unit just as current which is volt
            with a symbol V and also can have metric unit as mV,uV etc.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/unitvolt_4.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            With the explanation that we've made so far, the resistance is what
            is left now.
          </p>
          <h2>What is resistance?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-emphasis">Resistance</span> is the opposition of
            current flow in a circuit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now lets use a bigger picture to relate all this concepts.
            <span class="text-italics">Thanks to jason on this.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of the straw we use in sipping in our drink, if you put it to
            your mouth and blow air through it, air travels through the straw
            and comes out on the other end. The flow of this air is the current
            and the force or pressure from our mouth in order to blow air
            through the straw is the voltage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diameter or size of the straw will determine the amount of air
            out of the straw which means lower diameter results to less air
            which requires even more force to push the air through or large
            diameter which allows much air flow and can even require less force.
            This concept of large and small diameter is the concept about
            resistance.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="little-nugget">Another nugget</p>
            <p class="quote-text">
              There is no current without a voltage and vice versa. But the
              limiting body for both is resistance.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            To close case, <span class="text-italics">resistance </span> has a
            unit ohms and symbol is a greek like letter as shown below and also
            can have metric units as mOhms(milliOhms), uOhm(microOhms),
            Mohms(megaOhms) etc.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/unitohms_1.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Since we’ve discussed about current, what’s holding us not to talk
            about direct current (d.c) and alternating current (a.c) – which is
            the two types of currents we’ve.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Direct Current (D.C)</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-emphasis"> Direct current</span> as the name
            implies, current flows in one direction for example our 9v battery
            provides a constant current or direct current and to start off
            analyzing circuits we use d.c to grasp the concepts of how to use
            most of the techniques we have before we go in to deal with circuits
            with alternating current which is the second type of current we
            have.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Alternating Current (A.C)</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-emphasis">Alternating current</span> – is a type
            of current which alternates back and forth and this type of current
            is found in our home wall socket outlets. To have a better view is
            that, it flows in one terminal (line or wire) at the first cycle and
            on the next cycle flows through the other line (or wire). The number
            of times it flows back and forth depends on the standard defined by
            each country. For instance, in Nigeria we do have 50hz meaning it
            moves back and forth 50 times in one second (also called frequency)
            and in other countries like U.S they have 60hz and their symbol is
            shown below
          </p>

            This would probably be the end of this section so let’s move to the
            next and have different discussion.
