            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    When you ask someone how can I learn the basics of circuit analysis? Most times the answer is
                    practice-practice-practice. Though that’s right but you can only practice stuff you find easier to
                    understand and the necessary fundamentals to have are also right because how can you even analyze or
                    design a circuit if you don’t know how resistor works or you don’t love dealing with calculations.
                </p>


                <p>The case here is that don’t just learn circuit analysis techniques or concepts from textbooks as if
                    they are somewhat abstract or different, try to learn how they link with each other or what can they
                    be used for.</p>
                    <h2>The short circuit scenario</h2>
                    <p> For example, a short circuit is said to be by definition; that voltage across is zero
                        while the resistance is also zero but in reality how does this help; first let sketch out a simple
                        diagram for short circuit.</p>

                <p>
                    <image>this wire with zero resistance is the cause of short circuit right, likewise in real life
                        once you have a socket with 220v and you just plug in a piece of wire (while the two ends are
                        stripped off) <image> into the sockets input port then you just caused a short circuit and might
                            burn stuff or explode. Though if you are lucky and there is a fuse installed in your home,
                            it’s just going to disconnect the fuse instead of damaging our devices.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    But where is short circuit of benefit? </h2>

                <p>
                    If you charge an electrolytic capacitor, it charges mostly to its maximum at an instantaneous rate
                    and if left without been discharged can hold the charge for a very long time (even months) and can
                    cause harm when you come in contact with it (mostly causes jolting of the hand and vibration. <image>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So therefore you are advised to discharge all capacitors before dumping them in your box i.e. by short
                    circuiting them. You can use a piece of wire stripped at both ends just as it is been discussed lately or
                    use a
                    screw driver. </p>
                <h2>How will short circuit concept help us in circuit analysis?</h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, if you have a circuit (I mean be it a small or huge circuit), let’s say this circuit show
                    below <image> and the professor or the textbook you are reading from draws a wire across the battery
                        terminal, as shown below <image>.</p>

                <p>
                    Just know that those resistors are of no use because all the current will flow or follow the path
                    with least resistance i.e. zero resistance, rather than flowing through the 220ohms and 330ohms
                    resistors. </p>
                    <p>And this is one intuition of understanding how electricity works and that’s why mostly you
                        got shocked if our body possess little or no resistance (i.e. one’s body is hydrated, there is sweat
                        on his body or hands, or you place your foot on the ground with no insulator in between). But if you
                        are to wear insulators like gloves, shoe etc., you are saving yourself big time. </p>
    
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p class="little-nugget">A little tip</p>
                    <p class="quote-text">
                        while working with high voltage make sure to put one hand in your pocket or at the back and use
                        the other hand to do stuff. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Again let us look at another scenario which is based on open circuit (I love this concept so much).
                </p>
<h2>The open circuit scenario</h2>
                <p>Firstly, here are the concepts that I want you to put at the back of your mind. </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p class="little-nugget">Always recall</p>
                    <p class="quote-text">We have an open circuit only if a connecting point is broken at any point or
                        along the wire <image> i.e. no current flowing since if you could recall or have once hear this
                            that current will only flow if there is a closed path, and since the path is broken – no
                            current flow. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Now here is something fascinating, what will be the voltage across the terminal point a and b?</p>
                <p>You might be tempted to start using ohms’ law right, c’mon. since no current is flowing, no
                    voltage-drop across the resistance therefore the voltage at across point a and b equal the source
                    voltage (or voltage of the battery). also since the resistor doesn’t consume any energy the it has
                    no use there. </p>

                <p>So in summary if you see any open circuit like that just consider that the resistor is not there and
                    just by looking at the circuit you know what is what without even doing calculation.</p>
                    <h2>The open circuit in real life</h2>
                    <p>In real life, using same socket (220v) analogy, since you didn’t connect anything to it, it is in an
                    open circuited state and until you connect something to both terminals before it is no longer an
                    open circuit. </p>

                <p>You might also be curious enough and ask but no resistor there? Okay now go ahead and I’m serious
                    just take any resistor (make sure you were glove or use a safety measure) and put the resistor in
                    only on one terminal as shown below and measure the voltage across the terminals by using a voltmeter
                    or a multi-meter and you will find out that the resistor has no effect since no current is flowing
                    through it.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p class="little-nugget">PS.</p>
                    <p class="quote-text">
                        Always remember some of this cool stuff because that’s what makes you confident as an engineer
                        or engineering student.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Lastly as we’ve discussed before, not only understanding how things links with each other in circuit
                    analysis but also having a good background in mathematics and topics like algebra and the likes.
                </p>
                <p>But if there is the case that you are having difficulty with mathematics then I would suggest you
                    taking free courses on mathematics by Jason (math and science) or get the full course pack on his
                    site if you would love to learn more stuff on engineering throughout your days in college or
                    university as an engineering student or even just a curious electronics hobbyist.</p>
