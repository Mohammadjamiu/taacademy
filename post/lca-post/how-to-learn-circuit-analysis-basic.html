          <p>
            When you ask someone how can I learn the basics of circuit analysis?
            Most times the answer is practice-practice-practice. Though that’s
            right but you can only practice stuff you find easier to understand
            and the necessary fundamentals to have are also right because, how
            can you even analyze or design a circuit if you don’t know how
            resistor works or you don’t love dealing with calculations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The case here is that don’t just learn circuit analysis techniques
            or concepts from textbooks as if they are somewhat abstract or
            different, try to learn how they link with each other or what can
            they be used for.
          </p>
          <h2>The short circuit scenario</h2>
          <p>
            For example, a short circuit is said to be by definition; that
            voltage across is zero while the resistance is also zero but in
            reality how does this help; first let sketch out a simple diagram
            for short circuit.
          </p>
          <img src="../../images/sc_2.jpg" alt="short circuit" />
          <p>
            This wire with zero resistance is the cause of short circuit right,
            likewise in real life once you have a socket with 220v and you just
            plug in a piece of wire (while the two ends are stripped off) into
            the sockets input port then you just caused a short circuit and
            might burn stuff or explode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though if you are lucky and there is a fuse installed in your home,
            it’s just going to disconnect the fuse instead of damaging your
            devices.
          </p>
          <h2>But where is short circuit of benefit?</h2>

          <p>
            If you charge an electrolytic capacitor, it charges mostly to its
            maximum at an instantaneous rate and if left without been discharged
            can hold the charge for a very long time and can cause
            harm when you come in contact with it (mostly causes jolting of the
            hand and vibration.
          </p>
          <img src="../../images/jolt_1 (1).jpg" alt="discharge a capacitor with a piece of wire" />
          <p>
            So therefore you are advised to discharge all capacitors before
            dumping them in your box i.e. by short circuiting them. You can use
            a piece of wire stripped at both ends just as it is been discussed
            lately or use a screw driver.
          </p>
          <h2>How will short circuit concept help us in circuit analysis?</h2>
          <p>
            Firstly, if you have a circuit (I mean be it a small or huge
            circuit), let’s say this circuit shown below and the professor or the
            textbook you are reading from draws a wire across the battery
            terminal, as shown below.
          </p>
          <img src="../../images/prof_2.jpg" alt="example of short circuit" />

          <p>
            Just know that those resistors are of no use because all the current
            will flow or follow the path with least resistance i.e. zero
            resistance, rather than flowing through the 220ohms and 330ohms
            resistors.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this is one intuition of understanding how electricity works and
            that’s why mostly people got shocked if their body possess little or no
            resistance (i.e. if is sweat on the body
            or hands, or foot are placed on the ground with no insulator in
            between). But if we are to wear insulators like gloves, shoe etc.,
            we would be saving ourself big time.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="little-nugget">A little tip</p>
            <p class="quote-text">
              while working with high voltage make sure to put one hand in your
              pocket or at the back and use the other hand to do stuff.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Again let us look at another scenario which is based on open circuit
            (I love this concept so much).
          </p>
          <h2>The open circuit scenario</h2>
          <p>
            Firstly, here are the concepts that I want you to put at the back of
            your mind.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="little-nugget">Always recall</p>
            <p class="quote-text">
              We have an open circuit only if a connecting point is broken at
              any point or along the wire i.e. no current flowing since if you
              could recall or have once hear this that current will only flow if
              there is a closed path, and since the path is broken – no current
              flow.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Now here is something fascinating, what will be the voltage across
            the terminal point a and b?
          </p>
          <img src="../../images/ocscenario_2.jpg" alt="example of open circuit" />
          <p>
            You might be tempted to start using ohms’ law right, c’mon. since no
            current is flowing, no voltage-drop across the resistance therefore
            the voltage at across point a and b equal the source voltage (or
            voltage of the battery). also since the resistor doesn’t consume any
            energy then it has no use there.
          </p>

      

          <p>
            So in summary if you see any open circuit like that just consider
            that the resistor is not there and just by looking at the circuit
            you know what is what without even doing calculation.
          </p>
          <h2>The open circuit in real life</h2>
          <p>
            In real life, using same socket (220v) analogy, since you didn’t
            connect anything to it, it is in an open circuited state and until
            you connect something to both terminals before it is no longer an
            open circuit.
          </p>

          <p>
            You might also be curious enough and ask but no resistor there? Okay
            now go ahead and I’m serious just take any resistor (make sure you
            were glove or use a safety measure) and put the resistor in only on
            one terminal as shown below and measure the voltage across the
            terminals by using a voltmeter or a multi-meter and you will find
            out that the resistor has no effect since no current is flowing
            through it.
          </p>
          <img src="../../images/sockettest_3.jpg" alt="open circuit in real life using 220v socket" />

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="little-nugget">PS.</p>
            <p class="quote-text">
              Always remember some of this cool stuff because that’s what makes
              you confident as an engineer or engineering student.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Lastly as we’ve discussed before, not only understanding how things
            links with each other in circuit analysis but also having a good
            background in mathematics and topics like algebra and the likes.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if there is the case that you are having difficulty with
            mathematics then I would suggest you taking free courses on
            mathematics by Jason (math and science) or get the full course pack
            on his site if you would love to learn more stuff on engineering
            throughout your days in college or university as an engineering
            student or even just a curious electronics hobbyist.
