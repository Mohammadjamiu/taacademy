As an electrical engineering student, we all have that one course that frightens us and one of them
is electromagnetics field theory sometimes called engineering electromagnetics.

In this section, I would discuss why it is difficult to learn and understand electromagnetics field
theory and then proceed to how we can grasp the concepts using some techniques and tips.

## Why is electromagnetics field theory difficult to learn?

It is difficult to learn because, it is full of abstractions (meaning concepts that can’t be seen
physically with the naked eye except by imagination, experience or by accident) for example an
electric field or a magnetic field.

And the books used in learning electromagnetics field theory just focus on the technical and
calculations part rather than giving the whole concepts of most topics in it.

## How can we learn electromagnetics fast and easier?

As an advice to you the engineering students, the two things you need in studying and learning
electromagnetics field theory is -

1. Learn the concepts about each topic while,
1. Use the textbooks for solving problems after learning the concepts.

Now let's talk about few topics and the concepts behind them.

## Vectors

Mostly, the first chapter of every engineering electromagnetics book discusses about vector.

What vector actually signifies is a mathematical tool that helps us to represent stuffs in the real
world since we have left, right, up and down then in mathematics, we can do that with just vector -
by saying x direction is representing left, y is representing right and z is representing up or
down.

Now when you see anything related to vectors, you don’t just look at it as a mathematical tool only
rather you see it also in the real world.

## coulomb's law

The second topic mostly, is the coulomb's law and it relates the force of attraction between electric
charges but, here is something frightening, none of us has ever seen an electric charge even though
it is drawn in most textbooks as shown below.

But here’s the only way I can help you understand what an attraction between electric charges seems
like.

By getting two pieces of magnets, if you try to keep them as close as possible to each other, they
tend to attract but sometimes repels each other.

Now, with this concept you can relate what force of attraction or repelling is with respect to
charges.

<span class="text-emphasis">Another way to experience what an electric charge seem like in the real
world is - </span>
during the summer period when the surrounding is cold,
have you ever experienced a shock when trying to lay on bed?

If yes, then that’s little electric charges moving which leads to current and then spark that later
shocks you (don’t panic it doesn’t kill since it happens in a short period of time).

## Electric fields

Since we’ve got some ideas on what an electric charge is, and the whole phenomenon of magnetic
attraction, lets discuss what an electric field is. I know we‘ve never seen it also but, this field
can be understood with the same magnetic attraction phenomenon.

If you could remember, as soon you keep those magnets close to each other, they wanted to attract to
each other (note that it’s not always the case that they will attract, sometimes they do repel if
they are of the same pole).

The space between the magnets that wants them to attract is what we call <span class="text-emphasis">field</span> and if that field is caused by a magnet as in our case, we call it a magnetic field but if it is caused by an electric charge then we call it an electric field.

Remember that you can’t see or touch the field but they are there and the farther you keep the magnets from each other the less the attraction and less the field strength – hope you get the concepts.

With these concepts understood clearly, it can now be easier to get down to solving problems on electromagnetics theory from the basic to amateur level by following examples from textbooks.

Lastly, what I’m trying to figure out is making sure you learn the concepts of this stuffs in real life and then transition into the unreal world where electromagnetics lives.

Also there are resources that might help fast track your learning journey and it is summarized in this article.

Lastly, in the subsequent post we will be doing our best to bring forth some cool tips and strategy to help you understand and learn electromagnetics field theory.

And also, breaking down the concepts for each topic to our best of ability - cheers and have a nice day tooabstracter.
