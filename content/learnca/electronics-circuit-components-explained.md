<h2>Electronic circuit components and their functions explained</h2>

<p>
This section will be introducing the most important
circuits or electronics components because most of this components
are what circuits are composed or are made up of.
</p>

<p>
To start off with the one we are most familiar with which is a battery.
<br> <span class="text-emphasis">A battery</span> is considered as one of the source of voltage. It
has
symbols in circuit analysis as shown below:
</p>
<img src="/images/batterysign_1.jpg" alt="" />
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Use case</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Battery use includes
<p> - To power our devices</p>
<p> - To push electron through a conductor</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The next component of discussion is the resistor, <br>
<span class="text-emphasis">Resistor</span> 
which offers resistance
in a circuit and by its name tends to resist or limits the flow of
current in a circuit or branches in a circuit. Though it might sound
kind of a bad thing to have but the truth is if you try to connect a
9v battery to a torch that is capable of handling 3v then it’s going
to blow off. So that’s where resistor can come in to play by
limiting the amount of current flow as well as voltage across.
</p>
<img src="/images/tourchy_3.jpg" alt="" />
<p>
As you can see in the image above, resistor has a wiggly or zigzag
symbol. Below, it values is also written by it side which can be 4ohms, 20mOhms(milliOhms) etc.
</p>

<img src="/images/resistory_1.jpg" alt="" />
<p>
As battery is something we can get in the market place, resistor too
can be bought as a separate or discrete component and on it there is
no written value as we used to do if we are to analyze a circuit
rather it has a color code and this color code can be decoded and it
value can be known by referencing the datasheet.
</p>
<img src="/images/resistorlooky_1 (1).jpg" alt="" />
<p>
Now you might think that the next component should be current
no-no-no, current is not a discrete component and it is not what we
can see, touch or hold. It just magically flows through a conductive
material like wire or a resistor.
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Use case</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Resistor use includes
<p> - To reduce current flow</p>
<p> - To allow voltage to be dropped across it</p>
<p> - For safety</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another component that most of us might be familiar with is the capacitor. <br><br>
<span class="text-emphasis">A capacitor</span> in simple term is a passive device or component
that
store charges for a temporary period (more explanation would be
covered in other section).
</p>
<p>To even get a bigger picture of how a
capacitor works is, have you ever seen any device that you
disconnect its power supply but is still turned on for a little
seconds? if yes then it’s the capacitor that’s providing it stored
energy but over a short period of time and it is useful because of
the fluctuation that most power supply has which can destroy our
devices.</p>
<p>
It symbol is shown below and as always it value is written by it
side both when we are analysing circuit or when you go to buy the
component in the market. Unit is Farad (F) and values can be 4uF(microFarad), 3F etc.
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Use case</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Capacitor use includes
<p> - For reducing flunctuations in power supply</p>
<p> - Also for indication if our device is charging or working and many more uses</p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Next is an inductor,
<br><span class="text-emphasis">An inductor</span> which works same way as the capacitor because
they store charges but one of their difference is that it uses
wounded conductors rather than capacitor that uses plates separated
by air gap or dielectrics. It has unit henry(H) and can be 4uH(microHenry), 3H etc.
</p>

<p class="little-nugget">Use case</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Inductor use includes

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">The diode</span> (or di-electrode) is another component that allows the
flow of current in one direction which means if you reverse the
direction of current then it is not going to work – you can see from
the symbol.
</p>
<img src="/images/diodey_2.jpg" alt="" />
<p>
There are variations or different types of diode and the most common
one is the small light bulb that is found in most torches these days
and term as <span class="text-italics">light emitting diode</span> or L.E.D for short. If you would
love
to experiment this, go try it out as shown in image (2).

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Use case</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Diodes use includes
<p> - For protection </p>
<p> - Also for indication if our device is charging or working and many more uses.</p>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With the explanation of diode, it would be cool to talk about the transistor. <br><br> <span
class="text-emphasis">Transistor</span> which is the next gem
and the component behind all the microchips we’ve today starting from our mini calculator.
The transistor is based on the combination of certain diodes in a certain configuration and has a
symbol as show below:

</p>
<img src="/images/transistory_1.jpg" alt="" />
<p> This is to say that it is very important to how this component works.

</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Use case</p>
<p class="quote-text">
Transistor use includes
<p> - For switching - which do yields the ones and zeros (1's and 0's) that
our computers used to perform calculation

</p>
<p> - Two is for amplification of signals. For e.g. when we speak into a microphone, we get a loud
output from the speaker.
.</p>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="text-emphasis">ICs:</span> are called integrated circuit i.e. it’s a circuit on its own
and composed of other circuit components mostly the combination of diodes, resistor, transistor,
capacitor and inductor.
ICs tend to make tasks easier by allowing engineers to design device that can be small in size and
even allows things to be done by just adding or integrating more stuff to it instead of building
things all from scratch.
</p>
<img src="/images/ictimer_1.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Some other components and their use case are: <br>

</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Use case</p>
<p class="quote-text">
IC's use includes
<p> - To ease the time of building great electronics devices

</p>
<p> - There is no limitation to what an IC can do
</p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <span class="text-emphasis">The switch</span> which is use for connecting or disconnecting devices
from the energy source.
</p>
<p> <span class="text-emphasis">The fuse</span> is a safety component that is mostly installed or
inserted between an energy source and the
devices. This means that if there is excessive current drawn or fault, it’s just going to break off
and save those devices</p>
<img src="/images/fusey_1.jpg" alt="" />

<p>In summary this is the most common component that we would encounter or most likely work with.
Warning don’t stress out just go through them and get a little snippet of what this stuffs are and
as time goes on thing will become clearer.
