<h2>what is ohm's law and why do we need it</h2>
<p>
The ohms law is the fundamental law that relates voltage, current and resistance by using simple mathematical
expressions which says V = IR.

</ul>

<p>
Other variations of this expressions can be gotten by making current I and resistance R the subject formula as
follows.

<p>
To better understand how this formula relates voltage, current and resistance, we are to use I = V/R
expression.
If voltage V is
bigger then current I will be bigger but, if resistance R is bigger then current I will become smaller. </p>

<p class="quote-text">
One thing to note here is that this law is the fundamental and every other laws
or techniques
that are implored to solve or analyze circuits (e.g. kirchoffs law, nodal analysis and mesh analysis) will
always be based on ohms law - so put this at the back of your mind.

<p>Instead of wasting time on boring concept</p>
<p>Let's use these formulas to solve some simple circuits</p>
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">Ex.1:</span> Find the current flowing in the circuit or through the resistor
</p>
<img src="/images/ex1ohmslaw_2.jpg" alt="">
<p>To solve this, let us first define the sign of voltage across the resistor 4ohms - though not a must for now
but, we need to note this</p>
<p>
as it keeps moving through, the resistor will consume some energy and at this point the battery energy is reduce
so the other leg (or output leg) of the resistor
is marked as negative</p>
<img src="/images/knockrnew_2.jpg" alt="">
<p>Also if there are two resistors knocked together as shown below, the concept explained previously still holds
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="little-nugget">Note</p>
<p class="quote-text">
What to take note is, if current is entering, terminal or node is to be marked as positive but, if current
is leaving a terminal or node, it is marked as negative.
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Now back to our example, since voltage V = 20v and resistance R = 4ohms then from I = V/R, I = 20/4 = 5A;</p>
<img src="/images/fiveampans_2 (1).jpg" alt="">

<p>In comparison to the circuit drawn before, let's increase the resistance while keeping the voltage same and
see if the current will be reduced. I = V/R = 20/5 = 4A. As you can see, the current is reduced since it is
inversely proportional to resistance so ohms law is right. </p>

<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">Ex.2:</span> Instead of finding the current, let's find the voltage V.
</p>
<img src="/images/whatisv_2.jpg" alt="">
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">Ex.3:</span> What will the resistance R be if voltage V = 20v and current I = 4A;
</p>
<img src="/images/whatwillrbe_2.jpg" alt="">
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">Ex.4: Try this -</span> What will the current I
be if voltage V = 100mv and resistance R = 10ohms
