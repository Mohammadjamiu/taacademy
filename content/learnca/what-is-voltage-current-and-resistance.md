<h2>what is voltage, current and resistance?</h2>
<p>
Before diving into the explanation of the concepts, we need to talk
about circuit. Circuits are probably not something new to us and
most especially we the engineers. The world of circuits is diverse
and it can be a microchip found in our Ps5 game pad, smartphone or
our computer's motherboard.
</p>
<p>
The use case of circuits are endless which leads to new technology
coming up everyday. But before we can design or know how microchips
are built, we first need to understand how to analyze simple
circuits using different techniques that are developed by other
engineers to help ease our life.
</p>
<h2>What is circuit in general?</h2>
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">A circuit or electric circuit</span> is
a close loop that allows the flow of electricity. if the loop is not
closed but composed of electrical or electronics components, we call
it an <span class="text-italics">electrical network</span>.
</p>

<p>
Now let’s dive in and talk about the concept of voltage, current and
resistance which if the understanding is not clear might make us not
to understand how to analyze a circuit.
</p>
<h2>What is current?</h2>
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">Current</span> constitutes or is the
flow of electrons in a circuit. You can think of 'ocean current'
which involve stream of water flow instead.
</p>

<p>
Every wire or conductor has or is composed of atoms which consist of
many protons, electrons and neutrons.
</p>
<p>
 These electrons are stationary
since there are an equal number of positive ion (protons) and that
of negative ion (electrons), which means it's in a balance state.

</p>
<p>But to make it useful, we apply a battery which provides force
called <span class="text-italics">voltage</span> to push the
electrons inside the wire and as soon as electron flows or moves, we
get current.</p>
<img src="/images/electron-wire_1.jpg" alt="" />
<p>
Since electron is the negative ion which means if we connect a
battery to a device like a torch, current flows from the negative
side of the battery to the positive side. But by convention of
analyzing circuits for ease, instead of moving backward or from
negative to positive, it is adopted that current flows from positive
to negative, you need to get this right.
</p>
<img src="/images/current-denote_1.jpg" alt="" />
<p>
The flow of this current is quantified using the unit ampere or amps
for short and denoted as A. sometimes this unit are based on
metrics, meaning we do have mA (milliAmps), uA (microAmps) and so
on. The higher the amps the higher the current and vice versa.

It is current that kills not voltage. But a task is assigned to
you, which is to find out how much current is sufficient to kill
so we can be cautious.
</p>
<p class="quote-text">
But if you are curious you can ask us to tell you. Always remember
safety first is our tag as engineers.
</p>

<h2>What is voltage?</h2>
<p>
As we've seen from our discussion, we say that the force to push
current through a wire is voltage and that's the simplified
definition of what voltage is because, voltage doesn't move through
a circuit as current does but it is across a circuit or circuit
component.
</p>
<p>
A voltage is a source of energy and can be our battery or socket
outlet from our home. Voltage has unit just as current which is volt
with a symbol V and also can have metric unit as mV,uV etc.
</p>

<p>
With the explanation that we've made so far, the resistance is what
is left now.
</p>
<h2>What is resistance?</h2>
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">Resistance</span> is the opposition of
current flow in a circuit.
</p>
<p>
Now lets use a bigger picture to relate all this concepts.
<span class="text-italics">Thanks to jason on this.</span>
</p>
<p>
Think of the straw we use in sipping in our drink, if you put it to
your mouth and blow air through it, air travels through the straw
and comes out on the other end. The flow of this air is the current
and the force or pressure from our mouth in order to blow air
through the straw is the voltage.
</p>
<p>
The diameter or size of the straw will determine the amount of air
out of the straw which means lower diameter results to less air
which requires even more force to push the air through or large
diameter which allows much air flow and can even require less force.
This concept of large and small diameter is the concept about
resistance.

<p class="little-nugget">Another nugget</p>
<p class="quote-text">
There is no current without a voltage and vice versa. But the
limiting body for both is resistance.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To close case, <span class="text-italics">resistance </span> has a
unit ohms and symbol is a greek like letter as shown below and also
can have metric units as mOhms(milliOhms), uOhm(microOhms),
Mohms(megaOhms) etc.

Since we’ve discussed about current, what’s holding us not to talk
about direct current (d.c) and alternating current (a.c) – which is
the two types of currents we’ve.
</p>
<h2>What is Direct Current (D.C)</h2>
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis"> Direct current</span> as the name
implies, current flows in one direction for example our 9v battery
provides a constant current or direct current and to start off
analyzing circuits we use d.c to grasp the concepts of how to use
most of the techniques we have before we go in to deal with circuits
with alternating current which is the second type of current we
have.
</p>
<h2>What is Alternating Current (A.C)</h2>
<p>
<span class="text-emphasis">Alternating current</span> – is a type
of current which alternates back and forth and this type of current
is found in our home wall socket outlets. To have a better view is
that, it flows in one terminal (line or wire) at the first cycle and
on the next cycle flows through the other line (or wire). The number
of times it flows back and forth depends on the standard defined by
each country. For instance, in Nigeria we do have 50hz meaning it
moves back and forth 50 times in one second (also called frequency)
and in other countries like U.S they have 60hz and their symbol is
shown below

This would probably be the end of this section so let’s move to the
next and have different discussion.
