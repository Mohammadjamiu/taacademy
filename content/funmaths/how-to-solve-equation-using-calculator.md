<p>
In this post, we would solve a simultaneous equation in a very fast
and short time step by step using a Casio fx – 991MS as the
calculator to help us achieve our goal.
</p>

<p>
For example, let’s say our equation is [6x + 2y = 10] and [4x + y =
4] and we are to solve for the variables x and y.
</p>

<h2>Step 1 -</h2>
<p>
Switch on the calculator and then reset it, this is due to the fact
that sometimes we might have done some operation before which can
then alter our result for instance, if we put our calculator in
radian, the value is different from if it is in degree so therefore
always reset your calculator when starting off a new calculation.
</p>

<p>
Now to reset the calculator, we press
<span class="text-emphasis">shift</span> and then
<span class="text-emphasis">mode</span> and then
<span class="text-emphasis">3</span> and lastly we press
<span class="text-emphasis">equal [ = ]</span> twice.
</p>

<h2>Step 2 -</h2>
<p>
Press <span class="text-emphasis">mode</span> on the calculator
keypad <span class="text-emphasis">thrice x3</span> and then you
will see <span class="text-emphasis">EQN</span> and under it, there
is <span class="text-emphasis">1</span> written and that’s the value
we need to input into the calculator since we are dealing with an
equation.
</p>

<h2>Step 3 -</h2>
<p>
And after pressing <span class="text-emphasis">1</span>, it will
show something as below. Now we are to decide but since our equation
is based on two variables, we press he number
<span class="text-emphasis">2 </span> on the keypad then it’s going
to display <span class="text-emphasis">a1?</span> After pressing the
number 2 on the keypad.
</p>
<img src="/images/unknown_4.jpg" alt="showing the unknown to solve" />
<p>
The a1? Is the constant value beside the variable
<span class="text-emphasis">x</span> from the first equation which
is <span class="text-emphasis">6</span>.
</p>

<p>
So input 6 by pressing the number 6 on the keypad and then press
the equal <span class="text-emphasis">[=]</span>
sign.
</p>
<img src="/images/vara1a2_4 (2).jpg" alt="input equation value into calculator" />
<p>
Next, it will display <span class="text-emphasis">b1?</span> Asking
us to input the value of b1? Which is the value beside the variable
<span class="text-emphasis">y</span> in the first equation which is
<span class="text-emphasis">2</span> and we do so by inputting it in
and then press the equal sign
<span class="text-emphasis">[=]</span> again.
</p>
<p>
After pressing the equal
<span class="text-emphasis">[=]</span> sign, it will also display
<span class="text-emphasis">c1?</span> And the value for c1? Is the
value of the constant in the right hand side of our first equation
which is <span class="text-emphasis">10</span> so we input this as
usual and press equal <span class="text-emphasis">[=]</span> sign.
</p>
<img src="/images/vara1a2_3 (1).jpg" alt="inputting the second equation value into the calculator" />
<p>
Now it will ask for <span class="text-emphasis">a2?</span> Which is
the value of the constant beside the variable
<span class="text-emphasis">x</span> in the second equation so we do
the same step and input the value.
</p>
<p>
And also for <span class="text-emphasis">b2?</span>, we input it,
but in this case we see that there is no value present beside the
variable <span class="text-emphasis">y</span> in the second equation
so we take it to be a value
<span class="text-emphasis">1</span> since anything multiplied by
one is the same and after pressing equal
<span class="text-emphasis">[=]</span> sign, it’s going to display
<span class="text-emphasis">c2?</span> Which is zero and then after
pressing equal to, it will populate the value of the variable
<span class="text-emphasis">x and y</span> as shown below.
</p>

<p>
But at first it is the value of the variable
<span class="text-emphasis">x</span> that is going to be displayed
first and to get the value of the second variable
<span class="text-emphasis">y</span> we need to press the equal
<span class="text-emphasis">[=]</span>
sign again.

<p class="little-nugget">Note</p>
<p class="quote-text">
If you have 3 simultaneous equations, use the same process but
make sure to press 3 instead of 2 for the unknowns. Thank for
following up to this stage and if there is anything you want us to
discuss, give us a feedback and let us know.
